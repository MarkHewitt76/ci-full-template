# My first site using Cloud9, Git, GitHub and Gitpod

This site was created while coding along with the lessons on using [GitHub](https://github.com), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) that are part of the [Code Institiute](https://codeinstitute.net) Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications).

You can check out the website [here](https://markhewitt76.github.io/ci-full-template/index.html).

## Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE), [Git](https://git-scm.com) & [GitHub](https://github.com), and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Content

- Three simple pages, each with a navigation bar at the top.
- Each page is merely a series of links, consisting of logo images and text, to either the homepage of, or wikipedia page on, a variety of developer/web technologies.

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
